### Hi there! :wave:
I am an enthusiastic developer who loves to engage in app development, hobby projects and experiment with machine learning. I am hungry to learn and test new technology. I have a master's degree in machine learning from UiB, where I spesialized myself in methods from cluster analysis, topological data analysis and natural language processing. I currently work as a systems developer at Sparebanken Vest.
